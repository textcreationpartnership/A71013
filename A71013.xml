            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen it pleaſed God in his great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy to this Perſecuted <hi>Church</hi> and Haraſſed <hi>Kingdom,</hi> by a miraculous Providence to reſtore his Sacred Majeſty to his juſt Rights, and the <hi>Church</hi> to her Legal and Primitive ſettlement, I alſo (who was before neceſſitated to ſeek ſhelter elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where till <hi>the Tyranny was overpaſt</hi>) returned to my own Native Countrey; where I found diverſe (whom I left profeſſed <hi>Sons</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi>) turned <hi>Renegades,</hi> having forſaken their own <hi>Mother</hi> in the <hi>day of Trial,</hi> and betaken themſelves to that flattering <hi>Stepdame</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> This I reflected on with much regret, and ſo much the more, becauſe I found that with this defection from their <hi>Mother,</hi> they were alſo grown cool in their Affection to the common <hi>Father</hi> of their Countrey, our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord the <hi>King,</hi> as being ſowred with <hi>Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> or <hi>Protectorian Leaven,</hi> infuſed into them by the ſo much admired <hi>Thomas de Albiis,</hi> amongſt others, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved further, that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in theſe parts grew every day more inſolently active to bring more Griſt to their own Mill, and Liſt more men in the <hi>Popes</hi> Service, not only by Printed Books, but alſo by private <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>Manuſcripts.</hi> The firſt whereof that came to my hands was the ſhort <hi>Letter</hi> ſubjoyned to this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,</hi> to which I have (upon my Friends requeſt) framed an <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and here annexed to the <hi>Letter.</hi> The next I met with was a <hi>Manuſcript</hi> (that would fain uſurp the Title of <hi>Origo Proteſtantium</hi>) ſent me by a Gentleman for my opinion thereof, which after having peruſed and tranſcribed it, I returned to him again, and have here
<pb facs="tcp:60070:4"/>endeavoured to refute, and therein vindicate the <hi>Engliſh Reformation.</hi> The Author ſeems to be a man in great requeſt amongſt them, eſpecially if he be the ſame <hi>N. N.</hi> who aſſiſted in the late Conference; if not, he is probably that <hi>N. N.</hi> who was Second to <hi>Father Knott,</hi> as <hi>S. W.</hi> or <hi>W. S.</hi> was to Mr. <hi>White.</hi> Be the Author who he will, you are to underſtand, that as the deſign of the <hi>former</hi> was to ſeduce unſtable Souls from our <hi>Church,</hi> by ſuggeſting it to be no <hi>true Church,</hi> through the defect both of Moral and Perſonal Succeſſions; ſo alſo the great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this <hi>latter</hi> is, to prove the Nullity of our <hi>Church</hi> for want of Perſonal Succeſſion therein, chiefly upon the old <hi>Nags-Head Story,</hi> which might have paſſed for current <hi>Roman</hi> Coin perhaps [in <hi>57</hi>] when <hi>Lilly's Almanack</hi> and <hi>Mother Shipton's Propheſy</hi> were in vogue. But they are much out in their Politicks who think ſuch like Riff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raff as fitly Calculated for <hi>[75];</hi> the World is grown a little <hi>Older,</hi> and ſo much <hi>Wiſer</hi> too, than to believe all is Gold that Gliſters; and can diſcern between <hi>Legends</hi> and <hi>true Hiſtory,</hi> however the inſinuating <hi>Jeſuit</hi> would fain become again a Pearl for a Lady—</p>
            <p>Other <hi>Scripts</hi> and <hi>Prints</hi> of this nature and to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect are ſince come to my ſight, which perhaps I may (when I have nothing elſe to do) animadvert upon, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf obliged to lend my poor endeavours in ſcouring theſe <hi>Northern Coaſts</hi> (eſpecially) of thoſe <hi>Popiſh</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats, who count all Fiſh that comes to the Net, and will break all Laws to compaſs one unlawful Prize.</p>

Nevertheleſs it was judged expedient for her quiet, and the peace of the Realm, to keep always a Reſemblance of it in the Clergy, as the beſt remedy againſt <hi>Puritaniſm,</hi> which was thought by her Majeſty dangerous to Monarchy. The titles therefore of <hi>Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters</hi> were retained, as alſo in her own Chappel ſome Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the <hi>Altar</hi> and a <hi>Crucifix</hi> upon it. But what will they do for Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? That Form which was inſtituted in <hi>Edw.</hi> the ſixth's time was judged invalid, by publick Judgment in Queen <hi>Marie's</hi> days, inſomuch that Leaſes made by King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Biſhops, though confirmed by <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter,</hi> were not eſteemed good, becauſe, ſaith the Sentence, they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, nor Biſhops: ſee <hi>Brook's Novel Caſes, Plac.</hi> 463. <hi>fol.</hi> 101. <hi>impreſs.

                     <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> and Mr. <hi>Conſtable</hi> reported the ſtory, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is true. <hi>Neal</hi> was an eye-witneſs, and <hi>Conſtable</hi> took it upon truſt, and all the reſt hear-ſay men. So that the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon their credit and honeſty, who have crack'd their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit by their holy Fraud, and lying Legends, and practiſing the black Art of Equivocation; and their honeſty is juſtly ſuſpected, who care not what they ſay, ſo they ſay ſomething for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the good old Cauſe, as will hereafter be declared.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Dr. <hi>Biſhop,</hi> a faſt Friend to the Cauſe, in his Repr. of Dr. <hi>Abbot</hi>'s Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 120, confutes this way of Argumentation, ſaying; <hi>Any man not paſt all care of his Reputation, would be aſhamed to cite ſuch late partial Writers; it is either where their teſtimony is not contradicted by their Adverſaries, when they ſet themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly to detect falſifications in their Allegations, or elſe thoſe Proteſtants do annex the Authorities and Reaſons on which their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are grounded.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Teſtimonies of private men, or hear-ſay men, when croſſed by Authentick Records, are always ſlighted, and contemned. If the Homagers of a Manor ſwear to a cuſtom, (which is more than ſpeaking to it,) yet if there be any <hi>Court-Roll</hi> extant, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60070:22"/>which declares the contrary to their Depoſitions, their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony is thereby utterly invalidated. <hi>Baronius</hi> in the point of <hi>Maxentius</hi> his Birth, preſumed to correct all former Hiſtorians by the diſcovery of an ancient Coin, certainly an ancient Record is better than an ancient Coin can be; for ſtanding Records have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways by all Nations, and the conſent of Mankind, been eſteemed the ſtrongeſt human teſtimonies, and the beſt aſſurances of Faith, which ought not to be disbelieved or diſputed upon the reports of particular men, becauſe they have been purpoſely deviſed and preſerved for the diſcovery of Truth, and the deciſion of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies which might ariſe in after-Ages, and the rectifying of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mens ſeveral apprehenſions. Such as theſe we produce in this caſe, which have convinced and fully ſatisfied more ingenuous Adverſaries than <hi>N. N.</hi> or his Narrators ſeem to be: When Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> ſhewed theſe Records to Mr. <hi>Hart,</hi> he confeſſed they were undeniable. The <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> acknowledged that Father <hi>Oldcorn, alias Hall,</hi> took the leiſure and pains to ſearch the Records, who thereupon concluded them authentick. <hi>Arch-Biſhop Whitgift,</hi> with four other <hi>Biſhops,</hi> prevailed with four <hi>Popiſh Prieſts</hi> to view theſe Records, which when they had done, they declared to them freely that they were not to be doubted of.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It hath been the common practice of ſuch as theſe Narrators were, (as ſhall after more fully appear) to divulge ſtories by an holy fraud, either to ſtagger weak minds, or to ſettle the over-credulous <hi>Bigots</hi> of their party in a deteſtation of. <hi>Arch-Biſhop Whitgifts</hi> life, (whom the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> may believe if they pleaſe, if they will not take his word let them chooſe, and ſhew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,) hath given us a pregnant teſtimony hereof; for he informs us, that that <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> going to <hi>Dover,</hi> at his entrance into the Town, an Intelligencer from <hi>Rome</hi> landed, who wondred to ſee an <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and ſo honourably attended: but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the Sunday following waited on with a nobler Train, and hearing the ſolemn Service of the Church, he was overtaken with admiration, and told an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, Sir <hi>Edw.

                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Theſe his Narrators could never agree in the moſt material circumſtances of the ſtory, they cannot ſpeak either to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Conſecrators or Conſecrated, nor to the determinate place and time.</p>

                     <p n="7">7.

                     <p>The ſubſequent clauſe of the Act, (which <hi>N.

                     <p n="4">4. They were <hi>virtually, and in effect, produced</hi> by the Parliament in their reference to them, and were alledged and mentioned in Dr. <hi>Parker</hi>'s Life, as <hi>N. N.</hi> acknowledgeth in the next Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The advantage got <hi>by producing them,</hi> could only have proved their Legality; and the advantage loſt by concealing, might have brought their Legality into diſpute, but could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their Validity.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>The producing them</hi> would not have foiled their enemies; for produce them, (unleſs it be to an ingenious Adverſary,) the Sticklers <hi>have a deſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     <p n="1">1. Thoſe Authors he here mentions never touched <hi>at the Nags-head,</hi> if they had known or heard of any ſuch thing, they would have divulged it with open mouth; neither did they in all theſe Quotations ever ſo much as hint at, or reflect upon the Records, only Dr. <hi>Stapleton</hi> preſumes they were not Ordained according to the Preſcript of the Statutes themſelves, becauſe he conceived (as formerly hath been ſaid) that the Statute was not revived in Law <hi>primo Eliz.</hi> if otherwiſe, he thought the <hi>Parliament</hi> may be preſumed to be more knowing than he was in that Caſe; and we may further and juſtly preſume, that thoſe who left no ſtone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned for the advantage of the <hi>good old Cauſe,</hi> would not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leap ſuch Stumbling-blocks; for the two firſt of theſe Authors, they were ſo deep in rage, that they quite ſtifled reaſon; but Dr. <hi>Briſtow</hi> met with his match, one that paid him home in his own Coin; for Mr. <hi>Rainolds,</hi> he acted the part of a <hi>Renegado,</hi> who would be ſure by the <hi>fortiter calumniari,</hi> his high calumnies, to decline the ſhame of his Revolt. Dr. <hi>Stapleton,</hi> by <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> meant the <hi>Roman</hi> Encloſure, and ſo he fairly begged the Queſtion; and what he affirms, he proves not; for Dr. <hi>Harding,</hi> he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the ſame beloved fallacy, which they always make uſe of when they are put to a pinch. Thus their Argument proceeds, they were not Ordained by <hi>Romiſh Biſhops,</hi> nor after the Rite then uſed in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, therefore they were not lawful <hi>Biſhops,</hi> which is all one with this: <hi>Dr.</hi> Stapleton <hi>and Dr.</hi> Harding <hi>did not Commence Doctors at</hi> Oxon. <hi>or</hi> Cambridg, <hi>therefore they were not lawful Doctors.</hi> The <hi>Antecedent</hi> is granted; and for this reaſon it vvas improper and impertinent to produce the Records, for to what purpoſe is it to produce them in proof of that vvhich is confeſſed? no more than for to produce the Regiſteries of <hi>Oxon.</hi> for a Doctor's taking his Degree at <hi>Lovain;</hi> but the Conſequence
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60070:28"/>is denied, being impoſſible to be proved; for there have been, and there are novv <hi>lawful Biſhops</hi> in the Chriſtian World, vvho vvere neither Ordained by <hi>Roman Biſhops,</hi> nor according to the Preſcript of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> as confeſſedly the novv <hi>Biſhops</hi> of the <hi>Greek Church</hi> are, vvhom they all acknovvledg for <hi>lawful Biſhops.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2.

Further adding, that <hi>Mr.</hi> Harding <hi>himſelf was one of his Electors,</hi> none of this Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> could deny: and therefore he fell to the old Game of Tergiverſation, turning his back from the main Queſtion, and ſtarts a nevv one for a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate ſhift,</hi> having nothing elſe to ſay but this; they vvere not (forſooth) Confirmed by the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is an implicit confeſſion that all thoſe recited Acts were performed, only they wanted the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Confirmation: which yet the <hi>Biſhop</hi> with great evidence of Reaſon, and Primitive Authority, proved to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, and is contrary to all <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and the Practice of the <hi>Greek Church;</hi> and withal told Dr. <hi>Harding</hi> in civil terms, <hi>he would never give over that idle trade of begging.</hi> Thus this <hi>Biſhop Jewel</hi> maintained both the Regularity and the Legality, both of his Prieſthood and Epiſcopacy, though not with expreſs reference to the Records themſelves, yet implicitly to the Subject-matter thereof, particularly, <hi>Election, Confirmation,</hi> and <hi>Conſecration</hi> to his Epiſcopal Dignity and Office; and alſo propugned the Validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of both Orders from Scriptures, and the perpetual Tradition of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> purſuing Dr. <hi>Harding</hi> in all his ſhifts from Poſt to Pen, till he drives him to his <hi>Non ultra.</hi>

Though it were not evident it hath no Valid Ordination, yet ſo many doubts and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as they muſt acknowledg concerning their Ordinations, do demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Nullity of their Church; for if there remain one ſolid and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent doubt of the validity of Ordination in any Church, it is impoſſible it ſhould be the true Catholick and Apoſtolick Church, becauſe a doubtful Clergy makes a doubtful Church, and a doubtful Church is no Church: The ſtep to Chriſtian and Catholick Belief is the well-grounded Credibility excluding all prudent doubts, of the Clergy, we have the ſame of the Church, and of the Faith and Doctrine propoſed by its teſtimony; and the true Faith admits of no ſuch doubts. Therefore Proteſtants, before they can prudently believe themſelves to have true Faith, or be in the Catholick Church, muſt clear all the doubts objected againſt their Ordination. For though any Perſon ſhall not be convinced of the Nullity of their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet he cannot but harbour a prudent doubt thereof, there being ſo many Reaſons and Motives for it. Now, to Receive Sacraments from Prieſts of ſo doubtful Authority, is without doubt a damnable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, it being in the higheſt degree againſt the light of Right Reaſon, and Rule of Faith, to expoſe the Reverence of the Sacraments, and Remedy of our Souls, to ſo manifeſt an hazard.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Invocation</hi> of the Supreme <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Almighty</hi> Maker of Heaven and Earth, is an act of <hi>Juſtice</hi> as well as Religion, we wrong <hi>God</hi> if we pay not this tribute and Homage to him; and we wrong him too, if we offer or determin it to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſides him: For <hi>Invocation</hi> is of common right antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to any poſitive order due from man to <hi>God,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man, nor Society of man can on their own heads with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his allowance or conſent diſpoſe thereof without <hi>Sacriledg.</hi> Indeed if <hi>God</hi> had permitted this Honour to be given to any beſides himſelf, it would not be an injury to him to paſs it to them he ſhould grant it to.
